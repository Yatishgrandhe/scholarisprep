  stimulus_text = 'Historians reconstructing trade route 2 emphasize that camel caravans transported not only commodities but also astronomical tables, medical treatises, and navigational techniques across desert corridors long before printed cartography existed. Merchants who survived the crossing depended on star charts copied onto leather scrolls, and successive travelers appended marginal annotations that preserved empirical corrections across generations. A ledger recovered near waypoint 2 records caravan leaders, departure dates, and the scientific manuscripts exchanged at each oasis, suggesting that commerce and scholarship advanced in tandem rather than as separate spheres. When one city-state imposed punitive tariffs, caravans rerouted through secondary wells, and the intellectual networks rerouted with them. Modern scholars therefore treat these desert arteries as early information highways whose reliability depended on reciprocity among communities that rarely shared a written vernacular. The passage underscores how practical navigation imperatives drove the circulation of technical knowledge among traders whose primary motive was profit rather than pedagogy.',
