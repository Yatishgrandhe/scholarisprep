In 2013, critic Helena Marsh argued that public parks chiefly benefit residents who engage in vigorous exercise, using caloric expenditure as the only measurable outcome of green-space investment. She recommended athletic courts over quiet seating because, in her view, passive park use produced negligible health returns. Critics noted the model relied on self-reported activity logs rather than clinical biomarkers.

In 2014, economist Tomas Vela argued that automation would uniformly eliminate manufacturing jobs within a decade, citing early robotics deployments at automotive plants. His forecast treated every factory task as equally machine-replaceable and predicted that retraining could absorb displaced workers only if launched immediately at national scale. Editorial boards amplified the claim before longitudinal plant data had accumulated.

A 2022 industry analysis found that factories adopting collaborative robots often reclassified rather than eliminated roles, with technicians maintaining cells and logistics staff managing reconfigured lines.
