The writer contrasts cosmetic beautification projects—new planters and paint—with measurable acoustic interventions such as berms, low-noise pavement, and delivery-time restrictions. She acknowledges that complete silence is impossible in dense cities, yet insists that reducing predictable high-decibel spikes could yield health benefits comparable to modest improvements in green space.
