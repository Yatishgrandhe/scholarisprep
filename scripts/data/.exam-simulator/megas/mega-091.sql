In 2014, critic Helena Marsh argued that public parks chiefly benefit residents who engage in vigorous exercise, using caloric expenditure as the only measurable outcome of green-space investment. She recommended athletic courts over quiet seating because, in her view, passive park use produced negligible health returns. Critics noted the model relied on self-reported activity logs rather than clinical biomarkers.
