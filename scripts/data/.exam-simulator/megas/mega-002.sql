In 2013, physiologist Dr. Mara Lin argued that sleep consolidation primarily benefits declarative memory because hippocampal replay strengthens recently encoded facts. She dismissed motor-skill gains as short-lived unless participants slept immediately after practice. Her policy memo recommended school start times based solely on verbal test performance, treating physical education schedules as irrelevant to cognitive outcomes.

A 2025 study tracked adolescents in schools that delayed start times and found improved procedural memory on motor tasks even when verbal gains were modest.

In 2014, critic Helena Marsh argued that public parks chiefly benefit residents who engage in vigorous exercise, using caloric expenditure as the only measurable outcome of green-space investment. She recommended athletic courts over quiet seating because, in her view, passive park use produced negligible health returns. Critics noted the model relied on self-reported activity logs rather than clinical biomarkers.
