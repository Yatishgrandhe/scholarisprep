The economists interviewed owners who shifted product mix toward shelf-stable goods and services that did not depend on overseas shipping. National chains, bound to national contracts and uniform pricing algorithms, could not pivot as quickly without corporate approval cycles. The study does not claim small stores always outperform chains; rather, it shows that flexibility and local relationships became decisive when long-distance logistics failed.
