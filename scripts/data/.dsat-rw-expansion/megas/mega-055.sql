In 2013, economist Tomas Vela argued that automation would uniformly eliminate manufacturing jobs within a decade, citing early robotics deployments at automotive plants.

In 2014, critic Helena Marsh argued that public parks chiefly benefit residents who engage in vigorous exercise, using caloric expenditure as the only measurable outcome of green-space investment. She recommended athletic courts over quiet seating because, in her view, passive park use produced negligible health returns. Critics noted the model relied on self-reported activity logs rather than clinical biomarkers.

In 2015, physiologist Dr. Mara Lin argued that sleep consolidation primarily benefits declarative memory because hippocampal replay strengthens recently encoded facts. She dismissed motor-skill gains as short-lived unless participants slept immediately after practice.
