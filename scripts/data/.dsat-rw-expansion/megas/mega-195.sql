The awake group was kept in a quiet lounge with books and puzzles to prevent napping, yet their recall still lagged behind the sleep group on both immediate and delayed tests. Brain-imaging subsamples showed differences in hippocampal activity during retrieval, aligning with theories that sleep consolidates declarative memories. The researchers caution that the study measured short lists under lab conditions and may not generalize to complex real-world learning. Still, the controlled comparison isolates sleep as the key variable because study time, list difficulty, and initial exposure were matched. The passage presents sleep as a cognitive process with measurable downstream effects on recall.
