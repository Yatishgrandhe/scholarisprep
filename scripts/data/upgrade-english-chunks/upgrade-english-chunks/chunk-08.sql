  stimulus_text = 'Historians examining trade route 2 note that camel caravans carried not only goods but also astronomical tables, spreading navigation techniques across deserts long before printed maps existed. Merchants who survived the crossing depended on star charts copied onto leather scrolls, and those copies often accumulated marginal notes from later travelers. A ledger recovered near route 2 lists dates, caravan leaders, and the scientific texts exchanged at each oasis, suggesting that commerce and scholarship moved together. When one city tightened tariffs, caravans rerouted through secondary wells, and the astronomical knowledge rerouted with them. Modern scholars therefore treat desert trade networks as early information highways rather than simple supply chains. The passage emphasizes how practical navigation needs drove the circulation of technical knowledge among communities that rarely shared a written language.',

  stimulus_text = 'In her essay on urban soundscapes, writer 3 argues that city planners should treat noise pollution as a public-health issue, citing studies linking traffic noise to elevated stress hormones. She describes neighborhoods where sirens, construction, and highway hum overlap for eighteen hours a day, leaving residents with fragmented sleep even when air quality meets regulatory standards. Community interviews quoted in the essay repeatedly mention difficulty concentrating at work and heightened irritability at home. The writer contrasts cosmetic beautification projects—new planters and paint—with measurable acoustic interventions such as berms, low-noise pavement, and delivery-time restrictions. She acknowledges that complete silence is impossible in dense cities, yet insists that reducing predictable high-decibel spikes could yield health benefits comparable to modest improvements in green space. The essay concludes that sound belongs in urban planning budgets alongside light and air.',

  stimulus_text = 'Economists analyzing market 4 observed that small retailers adapted faster than national chains when supply chains stalled, partly because they could reorder from local wholesalers within days. While big-box stores waited for centralized distribution centers to reopen, corner shops phoned alternate suppliers named in handwritten contact lists. The economists interviewed owners who shifted product mix toward shelf-stable goods and services that did not depend on overseas shipping. National chains, bound to national contracts and uniform pricing algorithms, could not pivot as quickly without corporate approval cycles. The study does not claim small stores always outperform chains; rather, it shows that flexibility and local relationships became decisive when long-distance logistics failed. Readers should infer that organizational scale can become a liability during sudden disruptions.',
